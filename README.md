# test-driven-development-mime
A repo in which I reproduced what showed in the book "Test driven development" from Kent Beck

## Project purpose

[Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.

I read the book *"Test-Driven Development - by example"*, of Kent Beck, in which the procedure was explained with an example and by coding step-by-step. I found very important the fact of reproducing what I read in real code, so this is how this repo was born.

## Project structure

The project covers the first part of the book, in which a class "Money" is developed by using TDD (Test-Driven Development). The code is in **Java** and uses **JUnit** to test the code.

I used **VSCode** as editor and **Maven** as building tool. I also used a **Github Action** to automatically run the test on each commit

## Notes

The code is not reproduced **exactly** the same of the book, there could be differences
